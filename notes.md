* randomizer-iter-1-mv-scripts
    - the intent was to refactor all scripts so that they could be
      moved around easily.
* randomizer-iter-2-item-identities
    - intent is to
      1. simplify key item scripts so that they don't output much text
      2. figure out how to reassign item identities; thereby, the
         patch will be to reassign item identities instead of moving
         around scripts.
