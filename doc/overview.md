A technical overview of the crystal-key-item-randomizer application;
in the rest of this document, I'll refer to it as "CKIR".

# Basics

CKIR is an application for randomizing key items and badges in a
[Pokemon Crystal speedchoice][crystal-speedchoice] ROM.

Key items are randomized with other key items, and badges are
randomized with other badges.
