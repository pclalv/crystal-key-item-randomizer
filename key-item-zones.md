# key item zones

in ALTTP randomizer, it's known ahead of time that there will be
particular amounts of items found in dungeons. i forget the specifics,
but it's something like some dungeons are guaranteed to contain one
item, and some are guaranteed to contain two. 

i like this idea, and wonder how it might be applied to crystal.

instead of randomizing key items with one another, key items could be
randomized within a key item zone. each key item belongs to a key item
zone, which can be further rolled up into key item locales.
