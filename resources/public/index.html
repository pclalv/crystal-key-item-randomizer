    <h1>Pokemon Crystal Key Item Randomizer</h1>

    <h2>Randomizer</h2>
    <p>
      To randomize your ROM, select
      a <tt>crystal-speedchoice.gbc</tt> ROM file below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The seed used to randomize your ROM will be present in the
      randomized ROM's filename.
    </p>

    <div id="randomizer"></div>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      <span style="color: green;">Status: beta</span>; things are
      looking stable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Experimental features carry a higher risk of bugs and unbeatable
      seeds.
    </p>

    <p>
      This randomizer shuffles around HMs and key items; for example,
      instead of <tt>HM01</tt>, the player might receive the <tt>OLD
      ROD</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <tt>RAINBOW WING</tt> is <b>not randomized</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      PokeGear cards are <b>not randomized.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      All seeds generated by the randomizer should be beatable up to
      the user-specified endgame condition.
    </p>

    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      This randomizer supports Crystal Speedchoice v6.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other randomizations (TMs, encounters, moves, etc.) should work
      alongside the key item randomizations without conflict. Be sure
      to apply the key item randomization after all other
      randomizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The following speedchoice settings are required:</strong>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Kanto Access</td><td>Normal</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      In order to make for a more interesting randomizer experience,
      and in order to prevent some hardlocks, the randomizer patches
      the following changes into the game:

      <ul>
        <li>
          The player does not need to return the <tt>MYSTERY
          EGG</tt> to Professor Elm.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player does not need <tt>HM01</tt> to progress through
          Ilex Forest.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player may obtain the Flower Shop item even after
          defeating the Sudowoodo.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player may obtain the Flower Shop item without ever
          talking to Floria in the Flower Shop or on Route 36.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player may take the train without having fixed the Power
          Plant, as long as the player has the <tt>PASS</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player may obtain the Cianwood Pharmacy item even if the
          player have already returned the <tt>SECRETPOTION</tt> to
          Jasmine.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player may take the SS Aqua without having beaten the
          Elite 4, on any day of the week, as long as the player has
          the <tt>S.S. TICKET</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player may obtain the Pokemon Fan Club item at any time
          after fixing the Power Plant.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player may obtain the Underground Warehouse item at any
          time during of after Team Rocket takes over the Radio Tower;
          during the takeover, the Radio Tower Director will have the
          item, and after the takeover the item will be nearby in an
          item ball.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player may obtain all of the Goldenrod items (in
          vanilla: <tt>BICYCLE</tt>, <tt>COIN CASE</tt>, <tt>BLUE
          CARD</tt>, and <tt>SQUIRTBOTTLE</tt>), as well as the Radio
          Card, at any time, even during the Team Rocket Radio Tower
          takeover.
        </li>
        <li id="fix-radio-tower-boss-details">
          <span style="color: red">new</span> The player may skip
          straight to the 5F right side to battle with the Rocket boss
          if the player has the <tt>CARD_KEY</tt>; after defeating the
          Rocket boss, the item from the 5F left side
          (vanilla <tt>BASEMENT_KEY</tt>) will be available in an
          itemball nearby.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the player uses the <tt>BASEMENT KEY</tt> to visit the
        Underground Warehouse before Tean Rocket takes over the Radio
        Tower, the Underground Warehouse will be totally empty. There
        is no consequence to doing this, it's just a waste of time.
      </li>
      <li>
        If badge randomization is enabled, the gym leader's dialogue
        will not reveal which badge the player obtained; however, the
        player card will correctly display which badges the player
        has.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advice</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you can make it to Viridian City, then you can access
        Victory Road and the Elite 4 with any number of badges.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Ice Path item is accessible after collecting 7 badges.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="expanded-logic-details">Expanded Logic</h2>

    These are obscure and/or newly-discovered bits of vanilla game
    logic. They're safe to use, but they're sure to surprise some
    players.

    <ul>
      <li>
        The Blackbelt that blocks the player from reaching Viridian
        City via the Pokemon League Reception Gate (after Victory
        Road) disappears after the player fights the Snorlax; in this
        case, the player can reach western Kanto
        without <tt>HM01</tt>.
      </li>
    </ul>
