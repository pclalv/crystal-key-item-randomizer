## changes

In addition to swapping around key items, these changes open up the game:

* Travel to Violet City without having retrieved the Mystery Egg for Elm
* Progress through Ilex Forest without `CUT`
* Travel via train without having fixed the Power Plant
* Travel via SS Aqua without having beaten the Elite 4, on any day of
  the week
* Get Copycat's `LOST ITEM` from the guy in the Pokemon Fan Club at
  any time after fixing the Power Plant, even without talking to
  Copycat
