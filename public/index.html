    <h1>Pokemon Crystal Key Item Randomizer</h1>

    <p>
      Randomize the game's key items and HMs and see if you can beat
      the Elite 4.
    </p>

    <p>All seeds generated by the randomizer should be beatable.</p>

    <p>Status: alpha</p>

    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, this randomizer should support the following versions
      of Pokemon Crystal:

      <ul>
	<li>Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.0) [C][!].gbc (sha1: f4cd194bdee0d04ca4eac29e09b8e4e9d818c133)</li>
	<li>Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.1) [C][!].gbc (sha1: f2f52230b536214ef7c9924f483392993e226cfb)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This randomizer shuffles around all HMs and key items; for
      example, instead of HM01, the player might receive the OLD ROD.
    </p>

    <p>
      PokeGear cards are <b>not randomized.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, in order to make for a more interesting randomizer
      experience, the randomizer patches the following changes into
      the game:

      <ul>
	<li>
	  The player does not need to return the MYSTERY EGG to
	  Professor Elm
	</li>
	<li>
	  The player does not need HM01 to progress through Ilex
	  Forest
	</li>
	<li>
	  The player may obtain the Flower Shop item even after
	  defeating the Sudowoodo
	</li>
	<li>
	  The player may take the train without having fixed the Power
	  Plant, as long as the player has the PASS
	</li>
	<li>
	  The player may take the SS Aqua without having beaten the
	  Elite 4, on any day of the week, as long as they have the
	  S.S. TICKET
	</li>
	<li>
	  The player may obtain the Cerulean Gym item even after
	  fixing the Power Plant by talking to the Power Plant manager
	  again after handing over the MACHINE PART
	</li>
	<li>
	  The player may obtain the Pokemon Fan Club item at any time
	  after fixing the Power Plant
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	If the player uses the BASEMENT KEY to visit the Underground
	Warehouse before defeating Team Rocket in Mahogany Town, the
	Underground Warehouse will be totally empty.
      </li>
      <li>
	If the player uses the CARD KEY to defeat the Rocket
	Executives in the Radio Tower before obtaining the Goldenrod
	Underground item (BASEMENT KEY in vanilla), then the player
	**will not be able to obtain the Goldenrod Underground item**,
	potentially hardlocking the player from beating that file.
      </li>
    </ul>
