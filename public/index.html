    <h2>About</h2>
    <p style="color: red;">Status: alpha; there is a moderate risk of bugs and unbeatable seeds.</p>

    <p>
      This randomizer shuffles around HMs and key items; for example,
      instead of <tt>HM01</tt>, the player might receive the <tt>OLD
      ROD</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <tt>RAINBOW WING</tt> is <b>not randomized</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      PokeGear cards are <b>not randomized.</b>
    </p>

    <p>All seeds generated by the randomizer should be beatable.</p>

    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, this randomizer supports an experimental version
      of <tt>crystal-speedchoice.gbc</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other randomizations (TMs, encounters, moves, etc.) should work
      alongside the key item randomizations without conflict.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The following speedchoice settings are required:</strong>
      <table>
	<thead>
	  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th></tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	  <tr><td>Rocket Sections</td><td> Normal</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Kanto Access   </td><td> Normal</td></tr>
	</tbody>
      </table>
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      In order to make for a more interesting randomizer experience,
      the randomizer patches the following changes into the game:

      <ul>
  	<li>
  	  The player does not need to return the <tt>MYSTERY
  	  EGG</tt> to Professor Elm
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	  The player does not need <tt>HM01</tt> to progress through
  	  Ilex Forest
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	  The player may obtain the Flower Shop item even after
  	  defeating the Sudowoodo
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	  The player may take the train without having fixed the Power
  	  Plant, as long as the player has the <tt>PASS</tt>
  	</li>
  	<li>
	  The player may obtain the Cianwood Pharmacy item even if
	  they have already returned the <tt>SECRETPOTION</tt> to
	  Jasmine.
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	  The player may take the SS Aqua without having beaten the
  	  Elite 4, on any day of the week, as long as they have the
  	  <tt>S.S. TICKET</tt>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	  The player may obtain the Pokemon Fan Club item at any time
  	  after fixing the Power Plant
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	  The player may obtain the Cerulean Gym item even after
  	  fixing the Power Plant by talking to the Power Plant manager
  	  again after handing over the <tt>MACHINE PART</tt>
  	</li>
	<li>
	  The player may obtain the Underground Warehouse item at any
	  time during of after Team Rocket takes over the Radio Tower;
	  during the takeover, the Radio Tower Director will have the
	  item, and after the takeover the item will be nearby in an
	  item ball.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li style="color: red;">
	It is possible to hardlock if you do not obtain all of the
	Goldenrdod items before triggering the Team Rocket Radio Tower
	takeover (in vanilla: <tt>BICYCLE</tt>, <tt>BLUE
	CARD</tt>, <tt>COIN CASE</tt>, and <tt>SQUIRTBOTTLE</tt>). A
	fix is being worked on.
      </li>

      <li>
  	If the player uses the <tt>BASEMENT KEY</tt> to visit the
  	Underground Warehouse before Tean Rocket takes over the Radio
  	Tower, the Underground Warehouse will be totally empty. There
  	is no consequence to doing this, it's just a waste of time.
      </li>
      <li>
	Some dialogs don't reveal which item was obtained; this
	affects the following key items:

	<ul>
	  <li><tt>BICYCLE</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>RED SCALE</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>SECRETPOTION</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>LOST ITEM</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>MYSTERY EGG</tt></li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	The player must defeat the Rocket Executives in the Goldenrod
	Radio Tower in the same order as in vanilla; the player cannot
	skip the first one and go directly to the last one.
      </li>
    </ul>
